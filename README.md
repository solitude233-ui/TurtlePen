# TurtlePen

Turtle graphics is a method for drawing geometric primitives (such as points, lines, and curves) in the Cartesian (xy) plane. Logo was one of the early computer languages designed for educational purposes, and it had turtle graphics as one of its main features.

In turtle graphics, the user has control of a cursor (the turtle) that responds to commands such as “move forward 1.5 units”, “turn right 45 degrees”, and “turn left 25 degrees”.

The turtle has a pen that it holds in its tail. The pen can be either up or down. If the pen is down then as the turtle moves, it leaves behind a trail using a pen; the pen can have fields such as colour and radius to control the trail colour and thickness.
